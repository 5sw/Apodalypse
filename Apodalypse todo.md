#Apodalypse TODO

## App
* needs unit tests for Podfile parsing
* needs icon

## Document Window
* drag pod lines between different Pod files
* change of order of pod lines
* support for target-specific nesting of pods
* make toolbar buttons for 'pod install' and 'Show PodSpec catalog' 
	* icons for these toolbar icons
* enable editing in text view, hopefully Podfile parser is resilient enough
* if external PodSpec is used, allow user to specify a commit/revision
* support for :head flag

## PodSpec Catalog
* show component author
* show component platform
* show GitHub star rating for components hosted on GitHub
	* most likely need to ask for users GitHub credentials to work around GitHub call limits for unauthenticated calls
* support for Favorites
